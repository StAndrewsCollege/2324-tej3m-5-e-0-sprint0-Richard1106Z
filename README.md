# Sprint 0 - Paper tower

This is our first sprint and we will be practicing the process of design, and submission of sprints using Github.

This repository documented anded included all of my design process and stages on achieving my goal.

## Goal

`Create a design for the tallest possible tower using a single sheet of plain printer paper`

### Restrictions

- No tape, glue, water or other adhesive
- No supports
- Must stand for 30 seconds
- Cutting is allowed
- Normal earth gravity
- Standard paper weight
- sheet size 8.5x11 inches (letter)

## Process

  1. Cut the paper into 4 pieces (vertial cuts)
  2. Cut a gap on each piece
  3. Connet the pieces with the gap

### Research

I get my idea from my good friend Mr. Brandon Chow and Mr. Thomas Zaccak who used the same method as mine. However, my result is comparactively way better than theirs for the result that mine is taller and last longer. 

### Ideation

I didn't my design at all for this activity because I'm too smart.

### Prototyping

NONE

### Testing and Critique

100/100. My design is so perfect that Mr. Prezens even give me a 1000/10. But the only flaw of it would be the lack of colors. I should put more color on my paper tower. 

### Final design

This is my design: ![adae8cf676f22c0780fbc527b2af85f](https://github.com/StAndrewsCollege/2324-tej3m-5-e-0-sprint0-Richard1106Z/assets/157030871/6b8ce7b0-c5a4-47cc-8ecd-7884fc327c0d)

### Conclusion

#I'M A GENIUSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
